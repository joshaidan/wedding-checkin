# Wedding Check-In System

## Introduction
I'm getting married! Woohoo! The bride & I thought it would be fun to have a check-in system for our reception, that would among other things, tell people what table they were assigned to, track their arrival time, and even take their photograph for everlasting memories.

## Platform
The check-in system will run on a Raspberry Pi connected to a HDMI display. Guests will checkin by tapping a MIFARE Classic RFID card to a RC522 card reader connected to the Pi. I hope to have this housed inside a wooded box of some sort.
